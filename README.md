# React useEffect Cleanup Function Issue

This repository demonstrates a problem with the cleanup function in React's `useEffect` hook. The expected behavior is that the cleanup function should run before the next effect, but this is not happening consistently.

## Problem

The `useEffect` hook with an empty dependency array should only run once after the initial render. The cleanup function should be called before the next effect runs, but this is not always consistent.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the effect's cleanup function is correctly implemented and that the component's lifecycle is managed properly. This often entails careful consideration of the effect's dependencies and potential race conditions.
